In a groundbreaking report released by the National Urban Wildlife Institute, researchers have found that urban wildlife encounters have surged by an astonishing 45% over the past five years in major U.S. cities. The study, which tracked incidents in 25 cities, noted that there were approximately 32,000 reported wildlife encounters in 2022 alone, up from 22,000 in 2017. Experts attribute this spike to a combination of factors including urban expansion, which has encroached on natural habitats, leading to a 30% reduction in green spaces within these cities. Additionally, the report highlighted that raccoon sightings have doubled, with a particular incident rate increase of 60% in residential areas, while coyote sightings have risen by 35%, particularly in suburban fringes.

The economic impact of these encounters is also significant, with city councils spending an estimated $12.5 million annually on wildlife management and damage repair, a figure that has tripled since 2017. In Chicago, for instance, the city has allocated $2.3 million this year for specialized wildlife-proof trash bins after raccoons were responsible for over 4,000 trash spill incidents last year. Meanwhile, in Denver, where the coyote population has grown by an estimated 20% in the last three years, local authorities have introduced a 'Coyote Coexistence Plan' costing $1.5 million, aimed at educating the public and reducing conflicts. The study urges city planners and policymakers to consider wildlife corridors and green urban planning to mitigate these growing interactions, predicting that without intervention, encounters could increase by another 20% in the next two years.

Moniepoint Inc. recently released an "Informal Economy Report" on the Nigerian economy. According to their findings, Nigeria is home to approximately 40 million micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), with nearly 90% operating within the informal economy. This informal sector, often referred to as the shadow economy, consists of businesses that are generally untaxed and unregistered.

The report further reveals that over half of the informal economy population are under 34 years old. Specifically, the age distribution is as follows:

- 25 to 34 years: 43.1%
- 35 to 44 years: 28.9%
- 18 to 24 years: 14.4%
- 45 to 54 years: 10%
- 55 to 64 years: 2.8%
- 65 years and older: 0.6%

The informal economy plays a significant role in women's economic empowerment in Nigeria and across Africa, though challenges related to equity persist. Women represent 37.1% of the informal economy's workforce, while men make up 62.9%.

The impact of the informal economy is felt across all regions of Nigeria. Specifically:

- The South-West accounts for 30% of Nigeria’s informal economy
- The North-Central contributes 17%
- The North-East represents 6%
- The North-West holds 12%
- The South-East also makes up 12%
- The South-South constitutes 20%

While the informal sector in Nigeria has experienced rapid growth, certain industries have benefited more significantly from this expansion. Retail and General Trade lead the sector, comprising 24% of all informal businesses. Other key categories include:

- Food & Drinks: 13.4%
- Oil & Gas: 2.7%
- Health Care: 2.8%
- Fashion and Beauty: 8.1%
- Beauty and Personal Care: 6.9%
- Agriculture: 6.2%
- Construction: 4.3%
- Education: 4.1%
- Arts & Creative: 2.9%
- Casual Use: 3.0%
- Professional Services: 4.0%
- Others: 11.0%

In terms of transaction value in Naira, Retail & General Trade and Food & Drinks together account for over half of Nigeria’s informal economy, totaling 53.6%. Businesses in these categories typically include neighborhood shops, restaurants, supermarkets, and other vendors of daily necessities.

The informal economy is a vital and dynamic component of Nigeria’s economic landscape, encompassing a wide range of unregistered and often small-scale activities. This study seeks to highlight this sector, acknowledging its significant role in fostering innovation, generating employment, and sustaining livelihoods.
