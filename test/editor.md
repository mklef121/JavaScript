### General Comments 

### Turn1 
**Prompt** - Good work with the details of the prompt. 

**ModelA** - You could have also penalized the model for not providing a visually apealing design. Because there is some issue with the design. For example it used a plain output in the fields above the calendar. Moroever, On smaller screens, the `Period Duration (days):` text will be in first line and the input field will be in the second line which is not a good design. 
**ModelB** - You could have also penalized the model for not providing a visually apealing design. Because there is some issue with the design. For example it used a plain output in the fields below the calendar. Moroever, On smaller screens, the `Period Duration (days):` text will be in first line and the input field will be in the successive line which is not a good design. - You selected the `is Ideal` flag as `Yes` for this model. But the model has a rating of 3 for explanation quality. So, the `is Ideal` flag should be `No`. An ideal response is the one that has a rating of 5 for all the metrics. 

**Other Comments** - The model you chose as conversation history does not adhere to the instruction of choosing a model that is good because model B has a rating of 3 for explanation quality. On the other hand, model has a rating greater than 4 for all the metrics which is a good response. - There is no need to repeat the information in overall rationale again which is already mentioned in the individual rationales. If there is anything that does not fit in the individual rationale, you can mention it in the overall rationale. 

### Turn 2 

**Prompt** - Prompt seems okay. 

**ModelA** - Same comments related to visually appealing design as in Turn 1. 
**ModelB** - Same simple design issue. 

### Turn 3 

**Prompt** - Prompt seems okay. 

**ModelA** - Ratings are fine. 
**ModelB** - You selected the `is Ideal` flag as `Yes` for this model. But the model has a rating of 4 in instruction following. So, the `is Ideal` flag should be `No`. 

**Other Comments** - In preference you selected as both responses are bad but I can see model B has all the ratings >=4.
