In a 2021 report by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) titled Nigeria Education Sector
Analysis it was reported that Education and training in Nigeria are offered at pre-primary, primary, junior secondary, 
senior secondary, technical, and vocational education and training, tertiary and higher education, and basic and literacy education. 
Education services at these levels are delivered at public and private institutions, and through formal and non-formal streams.
Pre-primary in Nigeria has a robust learning structure, comprising kindergarten and three levels of nursery, which allows learners 
to systematically grow in learning as they transit towards primary education. In 2018, there were more than 7 million children 
attending pre-pri- mary school, half of whom were girls, although state-wide details reveal stark gender inequalities in the North East 
and North West geopolitical zones. Of greater concern is that these 7 million learners represent only a small fraction of the children 
eligible for early childhood development.

It was a shock to know that according to the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (2017) shows that only 1 in every 3 children aged 
between 36 and 59 months had access to early childhood care, development, and education (ECCDE) programs, with strong disparities 
between urban and rural areas, socio-economic backgrounds, and geopolitical zones. There is compelling evidence in support of early 
childhood education (ECE), which shows that 82% of children attending pre-primary are developmentally on track with regard to cognitive, 
psychomotor, and socio-emotional competencies. In comparison, only 50% of those who did not attend ECE programs are developmentally 
on track.

Primary schools host more than 28 million learners, half of whom are girls. The majority are enrolled in public institutions and 
nearly two-thirds are learning in rural schools. As observed in early childhood development and education, 
state-wide disaggregation reveals notable gender disparities in primary, which are particularly pronounced in the North West zone. 
Out of the 28.6 million learners enrolled in primary schools in 2018, 13.9 million were girls, implying a gender 
parity index (GPI) of 0.94, which was 0.03 units away from the lower limit of the recommended parity range. 
Learners attending primary education during the 2018/2019 school year are estimated to have been 90% of the eligible population, 
a significant increase from the gross attendance ratio (GAR) of 75% in 2016, which shows that the capacity of the system
is growing faster than the school-age population. Despite this expansion, primary education is particularly dogged by 
under/overage schooling. In the 2018/19 school year, the net attendance rate (NAR) is estimated to have been 65%. 
Taking into account the GAR of 90%, the NAR levels imply that for every 65 learners between the ages of 
6 and 11 attending primary school, at least 25 were outside the official school age.


Junior secondary enrolled 6.65 million students during the 2018/2019 school year, 3.17 million in rural and 3.48 million 
in urban schools. This is estimated to have been three-quarters of the children aged 12-14 who were eligible for junior secondary.  
Adjusting for early and late entry to school, the results find that in fact 80% of the children eligible for junior 
secondary were attending, but only 60% of them were attending junior secondary. The complement was either enrolled in 
primary due to late entry coupled with repetition or dropout and re-entry to school, while some (a minority) were 
attending senior secondary. A notable fact about junior secondary is that 6 in every 10 schools in the country are private, 
a phenomenon observed in primary too, and a testament to the important role played by the private sector in supporting education 
in the country.

In senior secondary, two in three eligible children were estimated to be attending school. 
According to the 2018/2019 Nigeria Living Standards Survey (NLSS), the GAR in senior secondary is estimated to have 
been 66%. Highest attendance rates were observed among urban boys at 87%, contrasted with 54% gross attendance 
for rural girls. Controlling for location, the gender differential remains marginal (6 points in urban and 2 points in rural â€“ both 
in favor of boys), highlighting the vulnerability of rural children in accessing school. The adjusted net enrolment rate 
shows that 67% of children eligible for this level of education (15-17) were attending school. However, only one in three 
was attending senior secondary, with the majority still trapped in primary and junior secondary school due to late 
school entry or grade repetition.

Nigeria national Bureau of Statistics released a Nigerian Gross Domestic Product report for Q4 2023 that provides data on Quarterly Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimates for the four quarters of 2022, the annual figure for 2022, the four quarters of 2023, and the annual figure for 2023.
Nigeriaâ€™s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 3.46% (year-on-year) in real terms in the fourth quarter of 2023. This growth rate is lower than the 3.52% recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 and higher than the third quarter of 2023 growth of 2.54%. The performance of the GDP in the fourth quarter of 2023 was driven mainly by the Services sector, which recorded a growth of 3.98% and contributed 56.55% to the aggregate GDP. The agriculture sector grew by 2.10%, from the growth
of 2.05% recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. The growth of the industry sector was 3.86%, an improvement from -0.94% recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. In terms of share of the GDP, industry, and the services sectors contributed more to the aggregate GDP in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. On an annual basis, GDP grew by 2.74% in 2023 relative to 3.10% in 2022. In the quarter under review, aggregate GDP stood at N65,908,258.59 million in nominal terms. This performance is higher when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 which recorded aggregate GDP of N56,757,889.95 million, indicating a year-on-year nominal growth of 16.12%.
The Nigerian economy is usually classified broadly into the oil and non-oil sectors. In the oil sector, the nation in the fourth quarter of 2023 recorded an average daily oil production of 1.55 million barrels per day (mbpd), higher than the daily average production of 1.34mbpd recorded in the same quarter of 2022 by 0.21mbpd and higher than the third quarter of 2023 production volume of 1.45 mbpd by 0.10mbpd. 
The real growth of the oil sector was 12.11% (year-on-year) in Q4 2023, indicating an increase of 25.50% points relative to the rate recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2022 (-13.38%). Growth also increased by 12.96% points when compared to Q3 2023 which was â€“0.85%. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the oil sector recorded a growth rate of -3.81% in Q4 2023. On an annual basis, the oil sector growth stood at -2.22% in 2023 compared to -19.22% in 2022. The Oil sector contributed 4.70% to the total real GDP in Q4 2023, up from the figure recorded in the corresponding period of 2022 and down from the preceding quarter, where it contributed 4.34% and 5.48% respectively.
The non-oil sector grew by 3.07% in real terms during the reference quarter (Q4 2023). This rate was
lower by 1.37% points compared to the rate recorded in the same quarter of 2022 and 0.32% points
higher than the third quarter of 2023. This sector was driven in the fourth quarter of 2023 mainly by
Financial and Insurance (Financial Institutions); Information and Communication (Telecommunication); Agriculture (Crop production); Trade; Construction; Manufacturing (Food, Beverage, and Tobacco) and Real Estate, accounting for positive GDP growth. On an annual basis, the non-oil sector growth in 2023 stood at 3.04% relative to 4.84% recorded in 2022.
In real terms, the non-oil sector contributed 95.30% to the nationâ€™s GDP in the fourth quarter of 2023, lower than the share recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 which was 95.66% and higher than the third quarter of 2023 recorded as 94.52%.

The Cadre HarmonisÃ©, an initiative focused on food and nutrition analysis, conducts studies
biannually (in March and October) across 26 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). With the Government's leadership and the United Nations (UN) system's support, the latest projection for 2024 shows that  Nigeria is expected to see about 26.5 million people grappling with high levels of food
insecurity, as disclosed by the Government of Nigeria and its partners, this indicates a sharp rise from the  18.6 million people currently vulnerable to food insecurity from October to December 2023.

Several factors are driving this trend, including ongoing conflicts, climate change impacts, escalating inflation, and rising costs of both food and essential non-food commodities (in part due to the devaluation of the naira and the discontinuation of the fuel subsidy). Persistent violence in the north-eastern states of Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe (BAY) hinders food availability and access.
Additionally, armed banditry and kidnappings in northwest and north-central states, including
Katsina, Sokoto, Kaduna, Benue, and Niger, exacerbate the prevailing economic struggles.

Of the 18.6 million people who experience food insecurity today, 3.3 million live in the northeastern states of the BAY region. This number might rise to 26.5 million nationwide by the height of the 2024 lean season ( and to 4.4 million in the BAY states) if immediate action is not taken.
The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that floods in October 2023 in Adamawa impacted around 8,500 households, leading to mass displacements, particularly among women, children, and the elderly. 
Such extreme weather patterns, linked to the El NiÃ±o phenomenon, are further undermining food security.


There is some good news anyway, Nigeria is the worldâ€™s largest cassava producer, at an estimated 61.121 million metric tons in 2021. Production has been growing at an average of 4% per year over the last 10 years. The Average Annual Demand 36.0 million metric tonnes and an estimated 30 million farmers are involved in the cultivation of cassava in Nigeria. Seventy percent of Africaâ€™s output is harvested in the countries of Nigeria, Congo, and Tanzania while Nigeriaâ€™s production accounts for approximately 42.25% of this. A total of 51 varieties have been acknowledged by National Root Crop Research Institute (NRCRI) Umudike report in 2021 as improved Cassava has become available in Nigeria. Notable among the varieties are: TMS 30572, NR8082, TME 419, Yellow root, TMS 90257, UMUCASS 47 (game changer); UMUCASS 48(obasanjo-2); UMUCASS 49;(hope) UMUCASS 50 (baba-70); and UMUCASS 51 (poundable). These varieties are adapted to different ecological zones, and have high root field resistance to pests and diseases. Most of the varieties will mature between 9-15 months on the fields.
The cassava industry is endowed with huge potentials which present great opportunities for small medium enterprises (SMEs) to maximize. Large producers, food and industrial sectors are growing rapidly, market share across the country is large with very lucrative domestic market returns and a large domestic import substitution market. Investors can take advantage of the rising demand for cassava and its products for engaging in the activities to their advantage. Such opportunities in cassava value chain investments include: 
(i) Production of Cassava planting materials (seed industry); 
(ii) Industrial processing for starch; 
(iii) Production of High-Quality Cassava Flour (HQCF); 
(iv) Fabrication and distribution of Cassava processing equipment; 
(v) Food grade starch; 
(vi) Production of ethanol; 
(vii) Packaged traditional foods; 
(viii) Pharmaceutical starch; 
(ix) Production of biofuel, and 
(x) Chips for export.

The African Union released a report on Nigeria agricultural sector, it revealed the strategic importance of the agricultural sector to the Nigerian economy, its contribution to GDP hovered between 24.45% in 2016 and 25.70% in 2020 (NBS, 2021).
Nigeria is blessed with abundant natural resources, including 70.8 million hectares of agricultural land area in agro-ecological zones that can support a wide range of food products. There is a huge market within the country and across West Africa of about 400 million people, which Nigeria could exploit given the new momentum to drive an African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) to which Nigeria is a signatory, also the country is also home to a wide array of SMEs in the agro-processing and distribution sector.
Despite the economic dominance of the oil industry in Nigeria, agriculture remains the foundation of the Nigerian economy. More than one-third of the population depends on the agriculture sector for employment. However, production levels have fallen in the last 20 years with the value-added per capita rising less than 1% annually. There have also been significant losses in Nigeriaâ€™s export power of key commodities such as groundnut, palm oil, cocoa, and cotton, attributable to several factors. Domestic food crop production has not kept pace with population growth, resulting in rising food imports and declining national food self-sufficiency, While Nigeria is the worldâ€™s largest producer of cassava, yam, and cowpea, it has been a food-deficit nation and a net importer of food and a major importer of wheat, rice, sugar and fish. The importation of these four commodities amounted to over one trillion naira in foreign exchange every year from 2005 until recently.
Some few points to note about the Nigerian agriculture  sector are as follows

1. Household Food Insecurity and Malnutrition: The Nigeria Multidimensional Poverty Index (2022) was released in November 2022. The report shows that out of Nigeriaâ€™s 200 million population, 38.6%, or 77.2 million citizens, face food insecurity, while 28.7%, which is 57.4 million people, face nutrition insecurity and 50.6%, or 101.2 million citizens, lack access to cooking fuel which contributes to climate change and health
issues. In 2020, 6.5 percent of children under five living in Nigeria were underweight; this was due to food shortages, often accompanied by diseases. Furthermore, the prevalence of stunting among Nigerian children reached 35.3 percent in the same year
2. Agricultural Productivity: The agricultural land area of Nigeria is estimated at 69 million hectares (75% of the total land area) of which 34 million hectares (ha) is arable. This comprises rich agro-ecological diversity that supports production of most commodities consumed in the country. Most of Nigeriaâ€™s 97,264,440 rural dwellers (48% of the national population) are smallholder farmers cultivating less than 2 hectares of land. They constitute about 70% of total farming population and produce up to 90% of the national agriculture output. In 2020, cereal yields and cereal areas harvested declined by 1.54% and 2.75%, respectively, leading to a decrease in cereal production of 4.24%. The production performance of some of the key staple crops in the country are as follows:
	- Rice: Rice is one of the most important staple crops in the country. It occupies a strategic position for the achievement of national food security and economic diversification. The estimated cropped area for rice in 2020 was 4,195,070 ha, which represented
an increase of about 1.66% over the 4,126,670 ha cultivated in 2019. Currently, the average yield of rice in Nigeria is 2.5 tons/hectare (rain-fed) with a potential yield of 6-84.5 tons/hectare in some locations under good management practices. The irrigated areas attract a yield of 6-8 tons/hectare. The national demand for milled paddy rice is about 117 million metric tons while production is about 86.5 million MT.
	- Maize: Maize production is presently at 18.0 million MT and the National demand is 23.0 million MT, leaving a gap of about 5.0 million MT. The set target to achieve self-sufficiency is to produce an additional 5 million MT, requiring the cultivation of 1,250,000 hectares. The national average grain yield is presently about 4.0 tons/ha and the planned target is to achieve 6.0 T/ha. These will be achieved through increasing the area under maize production, developing high yielding varieties, reducing the incidence of Fall Army Worm infestation as well as control of Aflatoxin. The low yield on maize production were attributed to menace and incidence of Fall Army Worm (FAW), limited availability of good quality improved seeds, low rate of adoption of improved varieties and agronomic technologies, appropriate fertilizers and other inputs. Maize is also cultivated in all the ecological zones in the country. Similarly, it can equally be cultivated under dry season conditions, making it available all-year round to meet any
sudden increased demand. All the plant parts are useful either as grain for humans or as feed for animals as well as other industrial uses.The total estimated land area cultivated for maize in 2020 is about 6,048,610 ha, indicating a 0.25% increase over the 6,033,410 ha cultivated in 2019. Similarly, maize production declined from 12.6 million tons in 2019 to 12.4 million tons in 2020 representing a 1.55% reduction arising
from rainfall deficit (prolonged dry-spell) in the South-West, North-Central and some parts of the South East Zones, flooding in some parts of the North East and North West Zones and inadequate fertilizer application on maize farms.
	- Wheat: Wheat is a strategic commodity after rice in achieving food and nutrition security with a vital role in supply of basic raw material to the flour milling industry whose main baking product is bread and various confectioneries, biscuits, noodles, semolina etc. National annual demand for wheat is 5.78 million metric tons per annum. The gap between production and national requirement/demand is 5 million metric tons per annum. The Government targets to increase wheat productivity from the current average 3.0 T/ha to 5.0 T/ha and the share of domestic wheat self-sufficiency from 5% to 50%, production from 71,000 MT to 3.5 million MT. The country further hopes to reduce post-harvest loss from the baseline 30% to 15% and increase the income of wheat farmers from baseline N 300,000/ha to N600,000/ha.
	- Cassava: Nigeria is the worldâ€™s largest cassava producer, at an estimated 61.121 million metric tons in 2021. Production has been growing at an average of 4% per year over the last 10 years. The Average Annual Demand 36.0 million metric tonnes and an estimated 30 million farmers are involved in the cultivation of cassava in Nigeria. Seventy percent of Africaâ€™s output is harvested in the countries of Nigeria, Congo and Tanzania while Nigeriaâ€™s production accounts for approximately 42.25% of this.
	- Livestock (cattle): The livestock sub-sector remains a major component of Nigeriaâ€™s agricultural and industrial sectors and plays a significant role in the overall national economy. It accounts for about 2-5% of the National GDP and 35% of agricultureâ€™s contribution to the GDP. The sub-sector is vital to the socio-economic development of Nigeria as the major source of high-quality food protein, providing about 36.5% of the total protein intake of Nigerians. Nigeria has an estimated cattle population of 20 million. Nigeria has good potential for investment in the dairy sub sector due to its conducive climate in most parts of central and northern states of the country, favorable ecologies to produce fodder crops in mixed farming systems, availability of under-utilized land on which improved pastures are an appropriate form of land use, strong potential demand for dairy products both at high and low ends of the economic scale, a longâ€“standing tradition in dairy production and high appreciation of fresh local dairy products particularly in the northern states. 
	- Fisheries and Aquaculture: Nigerians are high fish consumers and offer the largest market for fish and fisheries products in Africa. Total Fish Demand is 3.5 million tons while total Annual Domestic Fish Production from all sources 1.123 million tons resulting in an annual Fish Deficit of about 2.4 million tons. Per capita consumption fish intake is 17.5 kg/person/year resulting in a total fish import substitutions of 410,000 tons in 2016. It is therefore critical to substitute fish imports with domestic production in order to create jobs, reduce poverty in the rural areas where 70% of the population live and to increase revenue generated to the government. Fisheries contribute significantly to the nationâ€™s economy in terms of employment, income generation, poverty alleviation, foreign exchange earnings and provision of raw materials for the animal feed industry. The contribution of agriculture to GDP is about 40% while contribution of the fisheries sub-sector to agricultural GDP is 4.5%.
