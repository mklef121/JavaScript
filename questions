In a 2021 report by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) titled Nigeria Education Sector
Analysis it was reported that Education and training in Nigeria are offered at pre-primary, primary, junior secondary, 
senior secondary, technical, and vocational education and training, tertiary and higher education, and basic and literacy education. 
Education services at these levels are delivered at public and private institutions, and through formal and non-formal streams.
Pre-primary in Nigeria has a robust learning structure, comprising kindergarten and three levels of nursery, which allows learners 
to systematically grow in learning as they transit towards primary education. In 2018, there were more than 7 million children 
attending pre-pri- mary school, half of whom were girls, although state-wide details reveal stark gender inequalities in the North East 
and North West geopolitical zones. Of greater concern is that these 7 million learners represent only a small fraction of the children 
eligible for early childhood development.

It was a shock to know that according to the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (2017) shows that only 1 in every 3 children aged 
between 36 and 59 months had access to early childhood care, development, and education (ECCDE) programs, with strong disparities 
between urban and rural areas, socio-economic backgrounds, and geopolitical zones. There is compelling evidence in support of early 
childhood education (ECE), which shows that 82% of children attending pre-primary are developmentally on track with regard to cognitive, 
psychomotor, and socio-emotional competencies. In comparison, only 50% of those who did not attend ECE programs are developmentally 
on track.

Primary schools host more than 28 million learners, half of whom are girls. The majority are enrolled in public institutions and 
nearly two-thirds are learning in rural schools. As observed in early childhood development and education, 
state-wide disaggregation reveals notable gender disparities in primary, which are particularly pronounced in the North West zone. 
Out of the 28.6 million learners enrolled in primary schools in 2018, 13.9 million were girls, implying a gender 
parity index (GPI) of 0.94, which was 0.03 units away from the lower limit of the recommended parity range. 
Learners attending primary education during the 2018/2019 school year are estimated to have been 90% of the eligible population, 
a significant increase from the gross attendance ratio (GAR) of 75% in 2016, which shows that the capacity of the system
is growing faster than the school-age population. Despite this expansion, primary education is particularly dogged by 
under/overage schooling. In the 2018/19 school year, the net attendance rate (NAR) is estimated to have been 65%. 
Taking into account the GAR of 90%, the NAR levels imply that for every 65 learners between the ages of 
6 and 11 attending primary school, at least 25 were outside the official school age.


Junior secondary enrolled 6.65 million students during the 2018/2019 school year, 3.17 million in rural and 3.48 million 
in urban schools. This is estimated to have been three-quarters of the children aged 12-14 who were eligible for junior secondary.  
Adjusting for early and late entry to school, the results find that in fact 80% of the children eligible for junior 
secondary were attending, but only 60% of them were attending junior secondary. The complement was either enrolled in 
primary due to late entry coupled with repetition or dropout and re-entry to school, while some (a minority) were 
attending senior secondary. A notable fact about junior secondary is that 6 in every 10 schools in the country are private, 
a phenomenon observed in primary too, and a testament to the important role played by the private sector in supporting education 
in the country.

In senior secondary, two in three eligible children were estimated to be attending school. 
According to the 2018/2019 Nigeria Living Standards Survey (NLSS), the GAR in senior secondary is estimated to have 
been 66%. Highest attendance rates were observed among urban boys at 87%, contrasted with 54% gross attendance 
for rural girls. Controlling for location, the gender differential remains marginal (6 points in urban and 2 points in rural â€“ both 
in favor of boys), highlighting the vulnerability of rural children in accessing school. The adjusted net enrolment rate 
shows that 67% of children eligible for this level of education (15-17) were attending school. However, only one in three 
was attending senior secondary, with the majority still trapped in primary and junior secondary school due to late 
school entry or grade repetition.
